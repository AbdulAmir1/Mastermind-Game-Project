-- Main Logic
* The main goal is to guess the right 4-colors pattern that was set by your oponnent and win your turn.

How to do the Mastermind game:
-- Program Logic
1- player 1 make a 4-color pattern (eg. use an array of length = 4)
2- player 2 start to guess : (eg. gives an array of length = 4) 
3- the program compares the two arrys for the following:
  * the number of matching colors
  * the number of non-matching colors
  * update the scores list
4- when player 2 guess the right pattern he wins
5- the scores list is evaluated to calculate player 2 scores

-- Ui Logic
1- Using DOM, draw the Mastermind board
2- display a message to player 1 to make the 4-color pattern
3- when player 1 done,  display a message to player 2 to start guessing   by using the mouse to select positions and colors to make his guess.
4- when player 2 done, update the game board showing how many positions and colors are guessed correctly.
5- If player 2 found the right pattern, display a message
6- If player 2 failed to find the right pattern in less than 12 trials, display GAME OVER message.
